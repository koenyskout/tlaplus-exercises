# TLA+ Exercises: solutions

In this repository, you can find solutions to the exercises from the lecture on TLA+.
Each of the solutions contains comments to explain the model, point out some intricacies, and (sometimes) provide alternatives.

The solutions contain many examples of using functions and records to maintain state.

> **Some advice**: Try to make these exercises yourself first. Immediately looking at the solution will give you the *feeling* that you understand the specification and would be able to write this down yourself, but this will not help you write your own TLA+ specification.
> Only use the solutions when you get stuck, or to look at an alternative way of modeling compared to your own model.
