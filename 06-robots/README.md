# Robots

Make a model of multiple robots moving on a square grid. You want to prevent collisions by having the robots first obtain a reservation for a grid cell from a central authority.
Use non-determinism to make abstraction of the path planning of the robots.

Show that your protocol for obtaining and releasing reservations
- does not lead to collisions
- does not lead to deadlocks

_Hint: start small..._
